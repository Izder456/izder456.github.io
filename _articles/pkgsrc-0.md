# Okay, wtf is pkgsrc and why should I care?

pkgsrc is a collection of BSD-style makefiles that fetch, configure, compile, and install packages using a standardised tree of files and directories.

First off, you shouldn't *have* to care. This is me documenting the benefits of running an alternative source package manager (for me) on a source-based distribution of linux.

This however is not perfect. It will never be. If you break your sh1t, I didn't tell you to.

Fair?

### Why I like it

I like the BSD design of things and am kind of stubborn when it comes to a "traditional" UNIX-like paradigm. I usually use slackware or some derivative of it for that very reason.

I watched a few alphanerd videos on Odysee about portage and was intruiged by Gentoo's "do it yourself"-mantra.

So, I installed it.

missing some packages and not wanting to mess with portage overlays (cos the aforementioned stubborness) led me to find NetBSD pkgsrc.

### But how do I install this, magic internet person?

as much as a RTFM joke would be rude, NetBSD's documentation is solid. 

REMINDER:

I am in fact, *not god*. I can't solve every tech problem ever convcievable. This is not an invitation to spam me.

seriously, RTFM, kindly.

I'll link what I've used here:
