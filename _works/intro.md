# Hello and welcome to my blawg



heyo, I'm a queer autistic adult who spend a bit too much of their time with free and open source software.



I'm a bit of a wack-o, but thats okay. Its me. Its genuine.

### I like to rice



you can find me at reddit at u/izder456. I mess around in r/unixporn and some other reddit-y circlejerk/sh1tpost subs.

I lurch around cemetech (dot) net's effnet irc channel under the nomer izder456

### What this blog is for and what its not



I intend this blog to be a documentation of my tech misadventures and the likes.



Don't take anything that I may say here *too* seriously, I'm sarcastic but not always clear when I am or not.



This is not intended to be a personal blog, but rather a tips & tricks sorta deal.



Some bloke on bookface told me I was helpful or something. So, I guess I'll help any unfortunate internet netmeister that stumbles upon this trashcan of a site.



I apologise ahead of time or something, idk.

## Closing Notes
