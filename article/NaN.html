<p>Its out of order and leaves out some things people might want to conceptualise easily, like time</p>
<p>I propose YYYY/MM/DD/HH/MM/SS</p>
<p>but, that just makes it worse cos now its messy to the eye.</p>
<p>so, scratch that.</p>

<h3 id="unix-epoch-might-work%2C-idk"tabindex="-1">Unix epoch might work, idk</h3>
<p>The epoch is more that sufficient and in my opinion, is as simplistic as necessary.</p>
<p>It would be hard to read, though.</p>
<p>You <em>could</em> trim orders of precision in some number system that applies well if you want concise comprehension, while still being as consistent as possible.</p>
<p>Idkâ€¦ I have ASD, and this is pretty radical. But, it is a fun distraction from the definitely mundane life we all have that is the exact same as my own.</p>

<h3 id="seriously%2C-number-system%3F-come-on%2C-man%2C-whyyyyyyyyyy%3F"tabindex="-1">Seriously, number system? Come on, man, whyyyyYYYYYY?</h3>
<p>Because I can and its fun.</p>
<p>Iâ€™d think a base-12 system would play nice.</p>
<p>Itâ€™s just thinking in fives.</p>
<p>I mean, we already subdivide the hour by 15 &amp; 20 intervals. Minutes not as common but still work in some situations like in stop watches.</p>
<p>Might as well do 1/5. Its not as crazy to conceptualise when you realise that 24 hours in a day is also easily divisible by 12 less-significant figures.</p>
<p>Woah.</p>
<p>Idk</p>
